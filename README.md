## ü§ñ **Model Selection, Training & Evaluation**  

### **Models Built**  
1. **ARIMA**: Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average for trend and seasonality modeling.  
2. **ETS (Exponential Smoothing)**: Captures seasonal patterns in data.  
3. **FB Prophet**: Handles trends, seasonality, and external regressors like holidays.  

### **Model Evaluation Metrics**  
- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**: Evaluates overall prediction accuracy.  
- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**: Measures average error in predictions.  

| **Model**      | **RMSE**       | **MAE**        |  
|-----------------|----------------|----------------|  
| **ARIMA**      | 28,417.86      | 25,671.61      |  
| **FB Prophet** | 33,386.69      | 28,144.94      |  
| **ETS**        | 42,299.89      | 38,481.15      |  

**Best Model**: **ARIMA** achieved the lowest RMSE and MAE, making it the most accurate model.

## üìÖ **Final Forecast Results**  

Using ARIMA, the forecasted sales for **January-April 2024** are as follows:  

| **Date**       | **Forecast** |  
|-----------------|--------------|  
| 2024-01-01     | 116,317.28   |  
| 2024-02-01     | 116,682.89   |  
| 2024-03-01     | 113,380.77   |  
| 2024-04-01     | 115,998.18   |

## üß† **Conclusion nd Recommendations for the Video Game Company**

This project demonstrates how robust time series models can accurately forecast sales, helping businesses make informed decisions.  
Based on the EDA findings and the ARIMA forecast for January to April 2024, here are targeted recommendations to address the company's goals:

**1. Demand Forecasting & Inventory Optimization**

  * Adjust inventory planning: Ensure adequate inventory for the forecasted sales of approximately 115,000‚Äì116,000 units per month from January to February. Scale back inventory slightly in March (~113,000 units) and ramp up again in April (~116,000 units) to minimize holding costs.
    
  * Implement a dynamic inventory model: Use the ARIMA forecasts as a baseline and incorporate real-time updates to fine-tune inventory levels, reducing overstock and stockouts.

**2. Marketing & Promotional Strategies**

  * Targeted promotions: Focus holiday-season campaigns on Simulation, RPG, and Adventure games, with an emphasis on Xbox and Nintendo platforms.
   
  * Leverage weekend trends: Run weekend-exclusive promotions or discounts to capitalize on higher sales during this period.
    
  * Seasonal campaigns: Since sales historically dip from February to October, introduce mid-year promotional events or bundle deals to maintain customer engagement.

**3. Product Focus by Category and Platform**

  * Expand offerings in Sports: Since Sports games consistently drive sales, prioritize new releases or updates in this category across Nintendo and Xbox platforms.
    
  * Platform-specific promotions:
      Highlight RPG games for Xbox and Nintendo users.
      Promote Adventure games for PlayStation and Xbox users.
    
  * Balanced portfolio: Invest in diversifying content within Adventure and Simulation categories, as they perform well during specific periods.



### **Key Takeaways**  
1. **Best Model**: ARIMA was the most reliable model based on RMSE and MAE.  
2. **Data Stationarity**: Stationarity was confirmed, enabling accurate time series modeling.  
3. **Seasonality Patterns**: Strong seasonal trends were observed, significantly influencing sales forecasts.  

### **Future Work**  
- Include external features like game launches, global events, and marketing campaigns to refine forecasts.  
- Explore additional machine learning models such as XGBoost or LSTM for improved accuracy.
