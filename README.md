## ü§ñ **Model Selection, Training & Evaluation**  

### **Models Built**  
1. **ARIMA**: Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average for trend and seasonality modeling.  
2. **ETS (Exponential Smoothing)**: Captures seasonal patterns in data.  
3. **FB Prophet**: Handles trends, seasonality, and external regressors like holidays.  

### **Model Evaluation Metrics**  
- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**: Evaluates overall prediction accuracy.  
- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**: Measures average error in predictions.  

| **Model**      | **RMSE**       | **MAE**        |  
|-----------------|----------------|----------------|  
| **ARIMA**      | 28,417.86      | 25,671.61      |  
| **FB Prophet** | 33,386.69      | 28,144.94      |  
| **ETS**        | 42,299.89      | 38,481.15      |  

**Best Model**: **ARIMA** achieved the lowest RMSE and MAE, making it the most accurate model.

## üìÖ **Final Forecast Results**  

Using ARIMA, the forecasted sales for **January-April 2024** are as follows:  

| **Date**       | **Forecast** |  
|-----------------|--------------|  
| 2024-01-01     | 116,317.28   |  
| 2024-02-01     | 116,682.89   |  
| 2024-03-01     | 113,380.77   |  
| 2024-04-01     | 115,998.18   |

## üß† **Conclusion**  

This project demonstrates how robust time series models can accurately forecast sales, helping businesses make informed decisions.  

### **Key Takeaways**  
1. **Best Model**: ARIMA was the most reliable model based on RMSE and MAE.  
2. **Data Stationarity**: Stationarity was confirmed, enabling accurate time series modeling.  
3. **Seasonality Patterns**: Strong seasonal trends were observed, significantly influencing sales forecasts.  

### **Future Work**  
- Include external features like game launches, global events, and marketing campaigns to refine forecasts.  
- Explore additional machine learning models such as XGBoost or LSTM for improved accuracy.
